# âœ… Algorithms so far : 

## Kadane's Algorithm
- This is used for finding the maximum subarray in an array. At each position in the array we decide whether to extend the previous subarray ( maxEnding + arr[i] ), or start a new subarray from the current element ( arr[i] )
- - Time Complexity : O(n)
- - Space Complexity : O(1)
